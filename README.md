# Stress-Analysis-Pressure-Vessel-FEM
This project analyzes the stress of a thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessel using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in Python. It calculates hoop stress, longitudinal stress, Von Mises stress, and safety factor under various pressures and wall thicknesses, with visualizations, based on aerospace material properties
